Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
*The Gaming Room was the client, they wanted me to desgin their game "Draw It or Loose It" for multiple operating systems

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
*I think I was able to explain the benefits of each system and their drawbacks, I think I expanded a bit
past the uses and best cases for the operating systems.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
*Working through a desgin document tends to help me keep track of what im doing, and keep on task.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
*For one part I would revise is my evaluation, I overlooked the questions and was to broad when answering.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
*I interpreted the user's needs as being reliable, and remain to be simple. Its important to consider the user
needs when designing so keep the client happy and willing to continue to work with you.


How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
*For my approach I tried designing using the understanding of what the client wanted and how to make
it all work. Dividing these tasks allow for simplicity. In the future I think I would spend more time to
understand what the client wants and some better ways to address the desgin template.
